# MWS Udacity ND Project: Stage 1

#### _Submission by Mohamed El-Baz_

### Usage

1. Run `npm install`.

2. [optional] Run `npm run graphicsmagick` once to generate responsive images (uses [GraphicsMagick Image Processing System](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/)).

Here's the [download page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/files/graphicsmagick/).
Installation instructions for **GraphicMagick** can be found [here](https://github.com/andismith/grunt-responsive-images).
There are also detailed instructions for [installation on Windows](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/INSTALL-windows.html).

_Edit: For the purspose of the review, I've included the `img` folder, so running `npm run graphicsmagick` is no longer required._


3. Run `npm start` and visit the site at `http://localhost:8080`.
